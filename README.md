Task : We are using a 10-year dataset from an IoT sensor on the road to estimate the metrics Para-9, Para-10, Para-11, Para-12, and Para-13 for year 10.

Model :  To solve this issue, we used a Light Gradient Boosting Machine.Light Gradient Boosted Machine, or LightGBM for short, is an open-source library that provides an efficient and effective implementation of the gradient boosting algorithm.LightGBM extends the gradient boosting algorithm by adding a type of automatic feature selection as well as focusing on boosting examples with larger gradients. This can result in a dramatic speedup of training and improved predictive performance.

Results : The model's RMSE value is 68.76.
